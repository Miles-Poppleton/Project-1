Scope of Work
Project Background

The UNMC Water, Climate and Health Group is a multidisciplinary research team studying the effects of environmental factors—including air quality—on human health. In partnership with AirPurple, UNMC has deployed air quality sensors throughout Nebraska to collect continuous measurements of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and associated environmental variables.

Because air quality analysis is not a primary expertise of the current UNMC research team, UNMC issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) seeking qualified engineering consultants to analyze the AirPurple dataset collected from February 2024 through March 2025. [Your Engineering Firm] was selected to perform this analysis and prepare technical documentation and reporting to support UNMC’s research and decision-making needs.

Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

Analyze air quality data collected from AirPurple sensors across Nebraska.

Identify locations with elevated concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and VOCs.

Evaluate compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

Assess the influence of temperature, humidity, elevation, and geographic location on air quality.

Identify potential air quality “hotspots” that may pose public health risks.

Provide clear, reproducible analysis and documentation suitable for academic and professional review.



Scope of Services and Tasks

The consultant will complete the following tasks as part of this project:

Task 1: Data Acquisition and Preparation

Obtain AirPurple air quality data for Nebraska covering February 2024 to March 2025.

Compile raw datasets into CSV format suitable for analysis.

Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values, timestamps, and sensor identifiers.

Group all analyses by sensor name where applicable.

Task 2: Descriptive Statistical Analysis

Calculate mean and median concentrations of VOCs, PM2.5, and PM10 for each sensor location.

Identify the five (5) locations in Nebraska with the highest mean and median concentrations for each pollutant.

Task 3: Maximum Concentration Events

Identify maximum observed concentrations for VOCs, PM2.5, and PM10.

Determine the dates and sensor locations where these maximum values occurred.

Conduct preliminary research to propose potential causes (e.g., weather events, wildfires, agricultural activity, urban emissions).

Task 4: Environmental Influence Analysis

Categorize humidity levels as:

Low (<50%)

High (50–80%)

Very High (>80%)

Categorize temperature as:

Below Freezing (<32°F)

Cool (32–50°F)

Warm (51–70°F)

Hot (>70°F)

Analyze pollutant concentrations across humidity and temperature categories to evaluate their impact on air quality.

Task 5: AQI Health Risk Evaluation

Convert PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations to Air Quality Index (AQI) values using EPA guidelines.

Identify occurrences of AQI levels classified as “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.”

Document when and where these events occurred.

Investigate and discuss potential contributing factors based on publicly available data and EPA/AirNow resources.
